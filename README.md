# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying styles despite correct configuration and import statements.

## Bug Description
The `bug.js` file showcases a simple React component that attempts to use Tailwind CSS classes. Despite importing `tailwind.css` and using classes like `bg-gray-200`, `container`, `mx-auto`, `p-4`, `text-3xl`, `font-bold`, and `underline`, the styles are not applied.

## Bug Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution to this problem. In many cases, the issue stems from incorrect or missing build processes.  The solution might involve ensuring Tailwind's purge functionality is correctly configured to include the necessary classes.
